Overview
========

If a method is undocumented, consult the C/C++ SDK documentation, since many methods in this library are just wrapper functions.

Timestamps
----------

Unless otherwise marked, all timestamps are seconds since the Unix epoch (UTC). Note that this differs from the C/C++ interface which uses microseconds.
